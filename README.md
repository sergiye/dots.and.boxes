Dots & Boxes - simple game for windows

# How to play
- You and the computer take turns to place a line between to adjacent dots trying to form a box (by joining 4 dots with lines).
- When you make a box, a blue square will appear inside it. When the computer makes a box, a yellow square will appear inside it.
- The one who makes a box must take another turn.
- The one who makes the most boxes by the time all dots are connected wins.
- The game will determine at random whether you or the computer places the first line.
- To place a line, move the mouse cursor to the place between two unconnected dots. When a faint line appears, click on the mouse to make the line permanent.
